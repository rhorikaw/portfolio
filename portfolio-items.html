                    The home page of 180 Degrees Consulting @ UCI, which is a consulting club in the University of California, Irvine. 
                    I was asked to assist in developing their new website using the ReactJS framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was a great way to implement all of the knowledge that I had picked up from the previous
                    Javascript/ React projects. It also was a great opportunity to review a little bit of GraphQL, as we integrated 
                    Contentful to the website via GraphQL queries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the club wanting the repository to be private, there will not be a Github link for this project.

                    This project served as the sequel to the pathfinding algorithm visualizer. As a college student, sorting 
                    algorithms were one of the hardest things for me to grasp conceptually, and creating something like this had 
                    always been a small dream of mine.

                    This project served as a great way to learn about the different capabilities of the ReactJS framework, on top 
                    of reviewing the various algorithms that were covered in my machine learning courses at UCI. One of my favorite 
                    discoveries was the use of React's lifecylce methods.

                    This was my final project that I worked on during my time at Experian. It was an amazing opportunity to
                    reinforce my knowledge of RESTful APIs, as I worked with both the Slack and Github APIs to assign and send 
                    pull requests to appropriate members of the team via Slack.

                <p>
                    Due to this project being uploaded and deployed on private Experian accounts, there will not be a github repo or a live site.

                    This is a project that I am currently working on. It has been a great opportunity to reinforce my knowledge of the ReactJS framework and to
                    learn more about user authentication and how certain methods of authentication are vulnerable to certain types of attacks.

                    This is still a work in progress, so there will be no live link available until further notice.
